[work in progress]


New interpreter:
https://rattleinterpreter.pythonanywhere.com/


Notes:
-does not show exceptions yet (debug text is largely useless)
-`\` instead of `\\` is taken in the input because the parser changes slightly
-does not throw an error if too many inputs are given
-documentation needs to be better
-code for new parser is more messy than original code
-other characters might be broken (one `~` works fine, two break the code?????)
