# Q-
A new esoteric programming language

`Q-` is just a placeholder name - suggestions would be appreciated!

A more in-depth explanation of the list of commands and accepted formatting is coming soon..... for now, you can easily make use of some of the most basic functions:

            "+":add,
            "-":subtract,
            "*":multiply,
            "/":divide,
            "w":helloWorld,
            "R":reformat, #see interpreter for more info
            "s":store,
            "g":get,
            "<":pointerDown,
            ">":pointerUp,
            "P":setPointer,
            "p":prnt,
            "!":flag,
            "c":concat,
            "[":startLoop, #arguments for this act as an if statement (comparing the top of the stack to the argument)
            "]":endLoop, #arguments for this simply loop n times
            "%":modulo,
            "$":swap,
            "r":secondArgument,
            "=":topOfStackEquals,
            "_":pointedValueInStorageEquals,
            "t":stringFunction,
            ",":printCharAt,
            "a":arrayInitFunctions, #see arrayInitFunctions in the interpreter for more info
            "A":arrayOperations, #see arrayOperations in the interpreter for more info
            "m":matrixInitFunctions #as of right now, this has no function
