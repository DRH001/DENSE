Changes:


Loop structures work slightly differently. Loop arguments are now taken before the first execution of a loop. For example:

	10|[+]` now takes ` as 10 (the value on top of the stack before the loop) whereas it would've calculated ` after the first execution of the loop beforehand (i.e. to be 11)


Aritmetic functions will now drop ".0" from values if they are able. For example:

	1|+ will output 2, where it would've given 2.0 before


The command B now can take non-null arguments. Any arguments given simply multiply the output as a string. For example:

	5|!b+bB3 will output 565656


Strings can now be multiplied. For example:

	potato|*3 will output potatopotatopotato
